                <h1>Lito - Animations</h1>
                <h2>Animation in four directions</h2>

                <time datetime="21-09-2019">11-Dec-2019</time>
                <p>When I first started off this project I did not have any animations in mind. I only began to doodle a
                    little and soon found myself loving the little character I had created. I moved over to my computer
                    and quickly threw together the concept art you see below. I had recently played the amazing
                    metroidvania Hollow Knight as well as the mobile game Soul Knight. Both of these games and probably
                    many had influence on the look of my character.
                    I gave my character the name Lito because he is little and the opposite of light.
                </p>
                <figure class="size-2">
                    <img src="../../img/Lito-concept-art.png" alt="concep art of the character 'Lito'">
                    <figcaption>
                        <p>Lito - First concept art</p>
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>After the digital concept art was done I moved over to making a pixel version of Lito. When I create
                    a pixel version of a character always make the art as if it would later be used in a game. This is
                    just something I do because of my dream to create my own pixel game. That is why the image below
                    shows Lito in four directions for a top-down game perspective.</p>
                <figure class="size-2">
                    <img src="../../img/Lito-first-pixel-concept.png" alt="Pixel concept art of the character 'Lito'">
                    <figcaption>
                        <p>Pixel Lito in four directions</p>
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>This was my first time doing pixel art and I was happy with the first look. However I did think it
                    was good enough and I later made improvements to the character when I began animating him. Side
                    note: Some of my friends have said Lito looks like a jawa from the Star Wars Episode IV and others
                    think of the game Journey.</p>
                <p>Animating pixel art was completely new for me as well. Therefore I decided to get help by looking at
                    how others had created their animations. I also somewhat followed the structure of the running
                    animation in <a
                        href="https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fi.pinimg.com%2Foriginals%2F55%2Fd0%2Fa7%2F55d0a7fa9d937546f4703159d7c46820.png&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pinterest.com%2Fpin%2F789326272163794175%2F&tbnid=awf082avCmHyOM&vet=12ahUKEwiFk5-33q3mAhVI6CoKHRWbAjsQMygAegUIARDQAQ..i&docid=1IHkpivgl5CNVM&w=384&h=128&q=hyper%20light%20drifter%20running%20animation&ved=2ahUKEwiFk5-33q3mAhVI6CoKHRWbAjsQMygAegUIARDQAQ">this</a>
                    image. I specifically looked at the number of frames and the movement of the character. The
                    animations are really well made in the game Hyper Light Drifter and so I often used them as
                    reference and for inspiration.</p>

                    <img id="litorun" onclick="litoGif()" src="../../img/Lito_run_right_jpg.png" alt="">
                    <figcaption><p>Lito - Running animation</p></figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>All together I created over a hundred sprites, several running animations and even idle animation in all four directions. I did all of this in photoshop and due to it now being that pixel art friendly I am now going over to <a href="https://www.aseprite.org/">Aseprite</a> for all future projects.</p>

                <p>The Shadow Dash Project is my first proper try at making a game. It will have very simple mechanics and easy controls. As such, I am putting the difficulty bar at the limits of what I know so it will be a great learning experience as it can possibly be while still becoming a proper product.</p>
                <p>Let's start by answering the most important question; What do you do in the game? Well, for starters, It will be a fighting arena type of game. The playable character, will fight in different looking arenas that will essentially be one arena with multiple looks. Below is a picture of the first arena concept.</p>
                <p></p>
                <figure class="size-2">

                </figure>
                <p>You will control the character by holding down your finger on the screen and then it will run towards your finger. The character will be able to dash-attack towards a spot that you click on the screen. This will be the controls and then I want to make it more engaging by having mechanics like kill-reset and upgrades. With kill-reset I mean that you will not be able to constantly dash, there can be a delay after one or three dashes. But if you kill and enemy with a dash you can instantly dash once again.</p>
                <p>I believe I want the game to have an upgrade system like in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/241600/Rogue_Legacy/">Rogue Legacy</a>. In that game your character get a currency for killing enemies with which you can buy upgrades that will make your character stronger. That essentially makes the game easier the more you play. My game will be run-based, which means if you die then you will have to start over from the start. Having some kind of progress, like the upgrade system is a good way to make players feel like they are getting somewhere. It makes each run feel meaningful. There is great <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9FB5R4wVno">video</a> on youtube about this exact subject, made by Game Maker's Toolkit. A great channel filled with interesting videos about game creation.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>The theme of the game will be in a fantasy world inspired by east-asian culture. The first arena is a bamboo forest arena and the second one will be a shrine courtyard. After that I have no idea yet but perhaps the arena will be of an otherworldly style.</p>
                <p>That is all for now. I will probably rework my playable character and test out different looks as well as make the Bamboo forest more fleshed out.
